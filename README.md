## 2. Lab Submissions

🧪 Lab 1 — UI Components & Theming

YouTube Demo Link: https://youtu.be/Bfnkr-Ihqc8

Reflection:  
Transitioning from traditional XML layouts to Jetpack Compose required a massive shift in mindset. 
Learning how state drives UI dynamically allowed me to build the initial foundation of the PathWays interface. 
Figuring out modifier chaining and layout weights was a challenge, but it set the foundation for building responsive components.

🧪 Lab 2 — Component Interaction & State Management

Screenshots:

YouTube Demo Link: https://youtu.be/yct7aAV3Pxk

Reflection:  
This lab focused heavily on remember, mutableStateOf, and state hoisting rules. I implemented interactive elements like the 
profile preferences and application option switches. Managing state changes across multiple nested composables taught me how 
to keep unidirectional data flows predictable.

🧪 Lab 3 — Material Design 3 Theming & Composables

Screenshots:

YouTube Demo Link: https://youtu.be/S4jL-bp6I7Y

Reflection:  
I updated the app's interface using modern Material Design 3 (M3) features, specifically utilizing custom CardDefaults, ModalBottomSheet, 
and cohesive shape structures. I established the primary color palette (0xFF2E7D32 Green for growth and sustainability) to fit the professional 
tone required for a modern employment hub.

🧪 Lab 4 — Advanced Navigation Frameworks

Screenshots:

YouTube Demo Link: https://youtu.be/nFaROp_MMCM

Reflection:  
Implemented NavHost, composable routes, and handled explicit bottom tab state tracking. The trickiest part was configuring type-safe argument 
parsing across screen transitions (e.g., passing encoded job titles and salary identifiers down to the review screen without breaking the navigation stack runtime).

🧪 Lab 5 — Room Database & Local Persistence

Screenshots:

YouTube Demo Link: https://youtu.be/qDPf9kUaxlg

Reflection:  
Integrated an offline-first local-storage engine using Room. I designed entities, structured DAOs, and managed initialization 
patterns via an application context database builder. This guaranteed that job-seekers can save application histories directly onto device storage disks securely.



## 3. Project Submissions

🚀 Project 1: Foundational Architecture (Lab 4 + Working Navigation Flow)

Problem Statement:  
Marginalized communities suffer from severe economic stagnation due to fragmented visibility into regional job availability. Traditional job portals are bloated, 
confusing, and fail to map basic career entry points cleanly for low-income job seekers.

YouTube VSR Link: https://youtu.be/cRvSQi8570Y

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/AllyshaParin/PathWays

Lessons Learned:  
This phase taught me the vital importance of software clean architecture. Separating standard layout UI elements from internal routing stacks 
prevents bugs and makes expanding navigation flows down the line much easier.

🚀 Project 2: Advanced Integration (Lab 5 + Dynamic Features + Hardware Sensors + Cloud)
Problem Statement:  
Unemployed individuals often lack stable internet connections or professional assets (like headshots) needed to apply for jobs on the spot. They need an app 
that works seamlessly offline, handles profile creations via physical hardware camera sensors, and synchronizes data to the cloud automatically when a network 
becomes available.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/AllyshaParin/PathWays/tree/A216487_CikguIzwan_Project2

Lessons Learned:  
This project wrapped everything together. Resolving silent crashes with Android's FileProvider permissions taught me how strict platform-level 
security policies can be. Synchronizing local Room transactions with Firebase Cloud Services demonstrated how real-world, industry-standard 
production applications manage data continuity.



## 4. Reflection & Learning Journey

Growth Track (Lab 1 to Project 2):  
Looking back at Lab 1, I started by hardcoding basic layout surfaces. By Project 2, I was structuring complex asynchronous Coroutine loops, manipulating 
system storage files, intercepting runtime hardware permissions, and processing local-to-cloud sync patterns. 
Key Challenges & Mitigations:  
The toughest obstacle was getting the device's hardware camera to work without throwing security exceptions. I fixed this by updating file_paths.xml directory 
mappings and building clean directory instantiation blocks inside StorageUtils.kt to force folder builds before requesting system image file URIs.
SDG Impact Realization:  
By prioritizing an offline-first application strategy, PathWays addresses SDG 1 (No Poverty) directly. It ensures users living in areas with poor internet 
connection can still build profiles, scan resumes, and queue up job applications offline without being locked out of economic opportunities.
